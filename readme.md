# Mute mic

This is a fork of [MicMute](https://github.com/Anc813/MicMute) with ability to invoke mute/unmute from headsets, that have a volume control option, but are lacking physical mic mute button, like sony wh-1000xm5, for example.

Changing volume down and back up within one second results in mic mute and changing it the other way (up, then down) unmutes mic.

These triggers can be enabled in "Hotkey" menu.
